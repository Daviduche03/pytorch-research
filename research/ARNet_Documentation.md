## Theoretical Foundation

ARNet combines principles from several key areas:

### Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART)
- Based on Stephen Grossberg's work on how the brain processes information
- Focuses on the stability-plasticity dilemma: how to learn new patterns while preserving existing knowledge
- Uses resonance between bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down expectations

### Hebbian Learning
- Implements "neurons that fire together, wire together" principle
- Enhanced with modern stabilization techniques
- Uses correlation-based weight updates with conservative constraints

### Dynamic Systems Theory
- Treats learning as a dynamic process with attractor states
- Uses memory buffers to maintain stable representations
- Implements adaptive feedback loops for self-regulation

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Structure
```
Input → Embedding → Bidirectional GRU → Self-Attention → Memory Buffer → Output
```

Key features:
1. Bidirectional processing for context awareness
2. Multi-head attention for dynamic focus
3. Memory buffer for stable pattern storage
4. Resonance-based learning mechanisms

## Core Components

### 1. ResonanceModule
```python
class ResonanceModule(nn.Module):
    components = {
        'embedding': 'Word to vector transformation',
        'gru': 'Bidirectional sequence processing',
        'self_attention': 'Multi-head attention mechanism',
        'memory_buffer': 'Stable pattern storage',
        'projection': 'Dimensionality reduction',
        'output_layer': 'Final prediction layer'
    }
```

#### Mathematical Operations:

**Embedding Layer:**
```
E(x) = W_e * x
where:
- x: input token indices
- W_e: embedding weight matrix
```

**Bidirectional GRU:**
```
h_t = GRU(x_t, h_{t-1})
h_t_backward = GRU(x_t, h_{t+1})
output = [h_t; h_t_backward]
```

**Self-Attention:**
```
Q = W_q * H
K = W_k * H
V = W_v * H
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
```

**Memory Buffer Integration:**
```
M_new = 0.9 * M_old + 0.1 * mean(output)
output = output + mean(M_new)
```

### 2. Fast Learning Mechanism

The fast learning implementation uses Hebbian-inspired updates with stability controls:

```python
weight_update = correlation_matrix * learning_rate
weight_update = clamp(weight_update, -max_update, max_update)
weight = weight + normalize(weight_update)
```

## Learning Mechanisms

### 1. Standard Training
- Cross-entropy loss for prediction accuracy
- L2 regularization for weight control
- Gradient clipping for stability
- Learning rate scheduling with OneCycleLR

### 2. Fast Learning
- Hebbian-inspired rapid weight updates
- Conservative update constraints
- Memory buffer exponential moving average
- Stability preservation mechanisms

### 3. Adaptive Components
- Dynamic attention mechanisms
- Memory buffer updates
- Resonance-based pattern matching
- Stability-preserving weight updates

    'num_heads': 2,
    'dropout': 0.2,
    'l2_reg': 1e-5,
    'memory_buffer_size': 5

   attention_entropy = -sum(attention * log(attention))
   ```

2. Convergence Analysis
   ```python
   convergence_point = find_stable_window(loss_history)
   convergence_rate = calculate_convergence_rate(loss_history)
